# Arduino-x-Python-Hand-Gesture-driven-RC-car
Upload code to ESP32,run Python, and see the magic!

# Functionality
By using pixel distances and their averages(ratios) we can know if there is a thumbs up or thumbs down, then using udp packets we tell the ESP32 to either go forqard,backards,strafe,and so on.

# How to run
Run .py and upload the respective code to an ESP32 (or any board with wi-fi capabilities) on top of an rc car, make sure wiring is as dicted
