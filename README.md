# Arduino-x-Python-Hand-Gesture-driven-RC-car
Upload code to ESP32,run Python, and see the magic!

# Functionality
By using pixel distances and their averages(ratios) we can know if there is a thumbs up or thumbs down, then using udp packets we tell the ESP32 to either go forward,backards,strafe,and so on.

# Tech Stack
-OpenCV
-Basic Webcam
-MediaPipe
-Python
-Arduino IDE

# How to run
Run .py and upload the respective code to an ESP32 (or any board with wi-fi capabilities) on top of an rc car, make sure wiring is as dicted

# Why did i build it?
Experiment with Computer Vision, and thought it would be cool. 

# What i learned:
-Implementation hell when attempting to make Python Code and Arduino Sensors work together on a single system. 
-AI for Computer Vision and the endless possibilities for it. 
-Why fine tunning is important
-Wireless communication using udp packets
-2D lists practice
